# Lisa Lechner: Inferential Network Analysis (and Big Data): Challenges and Opportunities

This workshop contains material for the SSDL workshop on "Inferential Network Analysis (and Big Data): Challenges and Opportunities" by Lisa Lechner (University of Innsbruck).

**Abstract:** Why should we take networks seriously? What are the gains and sacrifices analysing our social world from a network perspective? The talk starts off with this general question and continues with a brief navigation through the methodological world of network analysis. A hands-on guide (in the statistical software R) on how to create, describe, and test patterns in networks follows. The last part of the talk is dedicated to current challenges in network analysis. This encompasses the lag of good and interesting theories in network studies as well as the challenge (yet opportunity) of estimating inferential network models on large datasets.
